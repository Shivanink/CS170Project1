#Notes from TA:
#general search
#empty q-> intialize first node
#while q is not empty, pop front of the q which will return a node (after popping see if the popped node is a goal state or not)
#generate child nodes -> insert in q after getting heuristics
#make a general search function, have the function take in the heurisitc and puzzle
#use heapq since it maintains smallest element/lowest priority at top
